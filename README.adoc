= Cloud Native Go Showcase

This is actually my first time I wrote something using the Go language.
So I tried writing a small microservice with a super simple hello API. 
The next iteration will use the Go Kit or Go Micro for more sophisticated 
integration features. 

== Prerequisites

In order to build and run this showcase you need to have a couple of things installed:

* The Go SDK (using Brew)
* The Docker Toolbox or native Docker, whatever you prefer
* The Make tool (optional)
* The Wercker CLI (optional)

== Building the showcase

In case you have make installed you can simply issue the following command to build and
install the application:

```shell
$ make install
```

In case you want to give Wercker a try (make sure you have the Wercker CLI installed) you
can issue the following command:

```shell
$ wercker dev --publish 8080 
```

This will build and run the microservice, and also watch for changes to the sources. If you only
want to run the Wercker build pipeline use the following command:

```shell
$ wercker build 
```

== Running the showcase

You have two options. Either build and run the showcase locally, or build and run the Docker image.

```shell
$ make docker
$ docker run --name cloud-native-go -it -p 18080:8080 cloud-native-go:1.1.0
```

Now open a browser or use somethin like `curl` or `HTTPie` and issue a GET request on the
URL http://192.168.99.100:18080/api/hello

== Deploying to Kubernetes

We will be using Minikube to run a small Kubernetes cluster locally. Make sure you have build
the Docker image locally.

```shell
$ kubectl create -f k8s-deployment.yml
$ kubectl get deployments pods
$ kubectl scale deployment cloud-native-go --replicas=3
$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
```

If you want to access the Go microservice you need to use the node port displayed by the last
command, e.g. `http GET 192.168.99.100:32278/api/hello`
